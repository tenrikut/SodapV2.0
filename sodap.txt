For the following project idea help me outline the core value proposition and initial thoughts on product-market fit. What are 2-3 key value areas? Document the outcome in a new folder called sodapv2  and new file it it call project-idea.md in sodapv2 folder. Current project is my version 1 of sodap,which decentralized shopping platform on Solana version 1, with functionality payment,and refund.  I want to  build SoDap v2.0 based on version 1 add funtiontionlities: Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), a loyalty reward token system, and membership-based benefits to enhance the user experience. The goal is to make Web3 commerce more flexible and engaging by allowing users to shop instantly, earn rewards with every purchase, and unlock additional benefits through their activity on the platform. I plan to implement these features using Anchor smart contracts, leveraging PDAs to manage BNPL loans, track reward balances, and assign membership tiers based on usage and token holdings. Users will receive SOD tokens as cashback or loyalty points, which they can use for discounts or exclusive perks. The platform is designed for everyday shoppers and merchants who want an open, affordable, and rewarding alternative to centralized e-commerce. By keeping interactions seamless and cost-efficient, SoDap 2.0 aims to bring real-world usability to the Solana ecosystem.
