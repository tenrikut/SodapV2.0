### üåü Overview

SoDapV2.0 is a decentralized in-store shopping platform on Solana with built-in Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL), a transparent loyalty system, and verifiable refunds. Payments run through on-chain escrow for security and instant settlement, while BNPL and loyalty logic are enforced on-chain for consistency and fairness.
- BNPL: On-chain 20% downpayment with escrow; remaining balance is scheduled off-chain. Refunds return only the downpayment, preventing abuse and preserving merchant protection.
- Loyalty: Earn 10 points per 1 SOL actually paid; redeem at 100 points = 1 SOL. Points are awarded and deducted based on real spend and refund amounts.
- Refunds: Fast, transparent, and programmatic‚Äîescrow-backed and verified on-chain, aligned with BNPL and loyalty rules for predictable outcomes.

### üöÄ What's New in v2.0

- **BNPL correctness & refunds**: BNPL refunds now return only the downpayment, not the full amount. Loyalty points deductions align with the amount actually paid.
- **Pay with Points (Direct & BNPL)**: Redeem loyalty points during checkout. Rate: 100 points = 1 SOL. For BNPL, the discount is applied to the total before calculating the 20% downpayment.
- **Loyalty points integration**: Earn 10 points per SOL you actually pay. Refunds deduct points accordingly. UI shows refund deductions with a red minus (e.g., -10).
- **Robust UX**: Payment dialog is responsive with fixed header/footer and scrollable content for smaller screens.

### üßæ BNPL - Buy Now, Pay Later

#### Downpayment and Refunds

- **Minimum downpayment**: 20% of the total after any points discount (on-chain enforced).
- **Escrow**: Only the downpayment is held in escrow for BNPL.
- **Refunds**: BNPL refunds return only the downpayment. Loyalty points are deducted based on what was actually paid (10 pts/SOL).
- **Grounded in code**:
  - On-chain: `sodap-mono/programs/sodap/src/instructions/bnpl.rs` (min_downpayment_percent = 2000), `sodap-mono/programs/sodap/src/lib.rs` (20% calculation).
  - Frontend refund flow: `sodap-mono/app/src/hooks/useRefundTransaction.ts`, `sodap-mono/app/src/components/dashboard/manager/RefundsTab.tsx`.
  - Tests: `sodap-mono/tests/bnpl_loyalty_integration.ts`.

#### BNPL Flow

- Choose BNPL in `PaymentMethodDialog`.
- Optionally redeem points (discount applies before downpayment calculation).
- Pay the 20% downpayment; remaining balance is scheduled off-chain/UI.
- If refunded, only the downpayment returns; points are deducted proportionally.



### üéÅ Loyalty Points Program

#### Earning Points

- Earn **10 points per 1 SOL actually paid**.
- Direct payments: points are based on the net amount after any points redemption.
- BNPL: points are based on the downpayment amount.
- Code: `sodap-mono/app/src/hooks/usePayment.ts`, `sodap-mono/app/src/hooks/useBnplPayment.ts`, `sodap-mono/programs/sodap/src/instructions/loyalty.rs`.

#### Redeeming Points

- **Redemption rate**: **100 points = 1 SOL**.
- Limits: You can‚Äôt redeem more than your available points or the order total.
- BNPL: Discount is applied to the order total first; then the 20% downpayment is computed on the discounted total.
- Code: `sodap-mono/app/src/components/payment/PaymentMethodDialog.tsx` (`pointsToSolRate = 100`, `downpaymentPercentage = 0.2`).

#### Refund Deductions

- Refunds trigger point deductions at **10 pts/SOL** of the refunded amount.
- BNPL refunds deduct based on the downpayment only.
- UI: Refund deductions are shown in red with a single minus (e.g., `-10`).
- Code: `sodap-mono/app/src/hooks/useRefundTransaction.ts`, `sodap-mono/app/src/components/profile/RewardsTab.tsx`.

### ü™ô Pay with Points

- Available for both Direct and BNPL payments in the checkout dialog.
- Real-time calculations, validation, and a ‚ÄúMax‚Äù button for quick redemption.
- Dynamic pay button reflects the final amount after redemption (and BNPL downpayment when selected).
- Code: `sodap-mono/app/src/components/payment/PaymentMethodDialog.tsx`.
